Introduction  
Over centuries, researchers have devoted effort s to understand  mental 
phenomena . The emergence of the complex systems approach has ushered in a new 
paradigm, offering a fresh lens through which to understand the complex and 
systematic nature of mental states  (1). This perspective treats mental processes as 
dynamic interplays influenced by both internal and external variables  (2). These 
insights have profound implications for psychopathology, including the early 
detection of warning signs, the prediction of symptom shifts, and transdiagnostic 
understandings of perception, behavior, thoughts, and memory  (3-5). However, a unified and quantified model that comprehensively encapsulates the properties of the 
human mind remains elusive. The challenge lies in defining the locus of the mind's 
existence, its evolutionary drivers, and the inherent lack of a cohesive theory. As such , 
there's a growing demand for top -down theory -laden models in current realm (6). 
To address this gap, we propose an example of generative model that draws 
inspiration from both Lacanian psycho analysis and active inference . By melding these 
two theoretical frameworks, we aim to offer a comprehensive model that captures the 
dynamic essence of the human mind. After introducing  key aspects of Lacanian theory, 
such as the three registers (Imaginary, Symbolic, Real), logical time, and desire , we 
find out the intimacy between these concepts and principles of active inference . A 
recurrent generati ve model  is constructed then,  allowing us to simulate and 
understand the complex unfolding of mental states.  Furthermore, we delve into the 
concept of desire as partial generalized synchronization  between individuals , offering 
a unique perspective on human interactions  and interpersonal dyna mics. To illustrate 
the practical implications of computational psychoanalysis , we apply our model to 
suicidal dynamic , and gain some computational  insights into the underlying 
mechanisms and potential prevention strategies. These  explorations underline the 
potential of computational psychoanalysis in unraveling complex mental phenomena.  
 
Introduction to  Lacanian psychoanalysis  and Active Inference  
Lacanian psychoanalysis  
Lacan is renowned for his  sophisticated  theory of psycho analysis, deeply rooted 
in philosophy  and linguistics.  An exhaustive overview of Lacan's theory is beyond the 
scope of this article, we will focus on three pivotal concepts: the three registers, logical 
time, and desire.  
At the core of Lacanian  psychoanalysis  are the three registers: the Imaginary, the 
Symbolic, and the Real. These registers serve as a fundamental framework for 
understanding where the human subject resides within their mental state s. According to Lacan, an individual's mental state is a blend of these three domains  that influence 
the subject simultaneously and interdependently, akin to a Borromean ring. The 
Imaginary represents an internal representation  of the external world. The dynamic 
interplay between the external world and the internal self leads to primary self -
identification and self -knowledge, though inherently distorted due to its "imaginary" 
nature. Consequently, the identification within the I maginary is essentially a 
misidentificatio n, forming the basis for psychosis  (7). The Symbolic domain 
encompasses the language. Put succinctly, since the "unconscious is structured like a 
language," the Symbolic operates akin to Hermeneutics, addressing issues of meaning 
generation, self -interpretation,  and intersubjectivity.  Hence the Symbolic is linguistic 
representation of the situations of subject. However, it's important to note that any 
representation is inherently incomplete, leaving aspects unrepresented. The Real 
collects the unrepresented,  thus existing as a realm of "impossi bility", a missing reality. 
Derived from the Real, the concept of repetition —manifested as an incessant attempt 
to represent the unrepresented —becomes another fundamental concept  of Lacanian  
psychoanalysis  (8). 
Logical time introduces the notion that human experiences cannot be neatly 
confined within a unidirectional and chronological understanding of time. From the 
perspective of logical time, “the past anticipates a future within which it can 
retroactively find a place” . In other words, the past bestows significance upon 
forthcoming events in an anticipatory manner, and the future imbues the past with 
retroactive meaning. Along logical time, meaningful relationships between events 
emerge, transforming time into a mechanism that generates significance . This concept 
underscores the anticipatory nature of human mind and emphasizes the importance 
of retroactive re construction (9). 
And what drives the ongoing evolution of the three registers within logical time? 
Repetition, as mentioned , serves as the driving force. For Lacan, repetition represents 
the return of something that maintains i dentical—object petit a , a concept rooted in the 
Real, leading to the endless  metonymic course of  desire. And orientation of drive is the 
running of desire towards object petit a . The history of subjectivity unfurls in the repetition of desire's trajectory:  the unrepresented  → object petit a → desire → object 
of desire → failure of representation → the unrepresented. That is, desire can never be 
satisfied, and the endless cycles contribute to so -called fantasy that need to be traversed 
by psychoanalysis practice.  
Ultimately, a rudimentary definition of the human mind emerges from Lacanian 
perspective — composite status of three registers which is perturbated  by desire 
running over the logical time.  
Active Inference  
Active inference, a burgeoning theory in neuroscience, aims to provide a universal  
principle of  living systems  at any scales like  neural activities, perceptions, and 
individual and collective behaviors  (10). The precise state of the environment, often 
concealed (referred to as the hidden state ), necessitates the system to deduce the hidden 
state (terme d inference) by employing an internal model founded on existing 
environmental knowledge, known as priors. Subsequent to observations, the system 
evaluates its inference, and discrepancies  (surprises) are fed back to the system to 
formulate conclusions ( posteriors ) and refine its internal model. An alternative way to 
fulfill original inference  is to change  the environment  actively. Therefore,  both of 
perception and action serves the unified purpose of enhancing the performance of the 
internal model , i.e., minimal surprises  (11). Then the concept of planning or decision-
making is involved in active inference . From a range of alternative  policies, the system  
tends to adopting the policy that is anticipated to optimize its internal model most 
effectively.  
The central tenet of this optimization process is the minimization of free energy —
a principle known as the  free energy principle . Originally a thermodynamic  concept, free 
energy quantifies the energy available in a system to alter its properties. In essence, 
minimal free energy implies a state of equilibrium within the system. In the context of 
active inference , free energy, encompassing both variational and expected free energy , 
gauges the “energy” required to modify one's internal model.  Rayn et al have p rovided a detailed and hands -on tutorial on active inference (12). And we hereby only focus on 
variational and expected free energy  to uncover the intimacy between Lacanian 
psychoanalysis and active inference . 
Based on priors over hidden state of environment 𝑃(𝑠)  and likelihood of 
corresponding observation 𝑃(𝑜|𝑠), an approximated posterior 𝑄(𝑥) is calculated . Real 
observation data serves as evidence for this inference, denoted as 𝑃(𝑜) . And the 
variational free energy F is mathematically expressed as follows:  
𝐹[𝑄,𝑜]=𝐷𝐾𝐿[𝑄(𝑠)||𝑃(𝑠|𝑜)]−𝑙𝑛 𝑃(𝑜) 
When model evidence is exceptionally robust,  a belief with lowest variational free 
energy could perform exact inference on hidden state, because  the Kullback -Leibler 
divergence between the approximated posterior and posterior probability is expected 
to be minimal.  Conversely, when evidence is relatively weak, an exact inference could 
be difficult . Then another way to minimize the variation free energy is to obtain 
evidence through action, transferring current  context to action  planning . For every 
conceivabl e policy 𝜋 , the anticipated  state of the system, denoted as 𝑥̃ , is deduced 
based on transition possibilities  𝑃(𝑥̃|𝑥,𝜋) . Then the expected free energy  G of this 
policy is calculated as:  
𝐺(𝜋)=𝐷𝐾𝐿[𝑄(𝑥̃|𝜋)||𝑃(𝑥̃|𝐶)]+𝔼𝑄(𝑥̃|𝜋)[𝐻[𝑃(𝑦|𝑥̃)]] 
The calculation of expected free energy G involves two items:  risks (divergences 
between expected and preferred states) and expected ambiguity  (Shannon entropy of 
expected outcomes) . Therefore, policy with lowest expected free energy could balance 
risks and ambiguity, providing a solution to the exploration -exploitation dilemma  (12).  
In essence, expected free energy is a “belief that one will minimize free energy in the 
future” (11). This replicates the mechanism of logical time, as Lacan described: “the 
past anticipates a future within which it can retroactively find a place” (9). 
Additionally, both Lacanian psychoanalysis and active inference are on how external 
world is represented by internal models, and the unrepresented or surprises plays a 
significant role in the dynamical operations. The intimacy between these two 
theoretic al frameworks lays foundations of our incorporating work, and in the next section, we propose a generative model for further explorations.   
Generative model  of Lacanian  psychoanalysis  
Inspired by previous research in Lacanian neuropsychoanalysis, we begin with  an 
initial endeavor to roughly map the functions of the three registers onto the brain 
(Figure 1. a), setting the stage for our formal generative model. Our intention is not to 
achieve a precise anatomical or functional mapping, but rather to establish an intuitive 
framework for defining  the system of current interest . The Real is situated within the 
upper brainstem and diencephalic system, as these areas play a fundamental role in 
affective experiences, consciousness, and the primary needs of the body such  as 
sustenance, sexuality, and homeostasis  (13). The Imaginary, on the other hand, 
corresponds to the parietal and occipital lobes, given their involvement in motor 
control, visual perception, and the representation of self (body -image). The Symbolic 
domain is allocated to the prefrontal and parietal lobes, responsible for executing 
language processing, generating meaning, and conducting thought experiments based 
on anticipation and retroaction  (14).

psychoanalysis and active inference. (a) An intuitive mapping  of three registers  onto brain 
regions. R: the Real; S: the Symbolic; I: the Imaginary (b) F lowchart  of our recurrent 
generative model with three interconnected  basic units  operating in discrete time. (c) A 
closer look at  basic unit within the generative mode l.  (d) Simulation of dynamics of three 
registers when the Symbolic register is perturbated. 
Subsequently, we put forth a recurrent generative model comprising three basic 
units operating in discrete time, as depicted in Figure 1. b. Zooming  into the basic unit 
(Figure 1. c), at time step τ, the unit infers the hidden state based on observations and 
the corresponding likelihood. It then evaluates the expected free energy for each 
alternative policy π, to realize specific preferences. As previously mentioned, the 
system inclines towards polic ies with lowest expected free energy. Upon adopting a 
policy π, the divergences  between preferences and outcomes are calculated. This 
divergence element, serving as a retrospective assessment of policy effects, propagates 
globally to all three units (each with distinct weights). It contributes to the updating of 
the actual (variational) free energy —an entity we may term " residual free energy " to 
emphasize  its post-hoc rationale.  Beliefs with minimal residual free energy servers as  
the current posteriors , and as priors for the subsequent time step. Expected and 
residual free energy enables the explicit implementation of logical time within our 
model.  
To examine the model , we simulat e the 15-timesteps  dynamics of the three 
registers when the Symbolic register is perturbed , utilizing  Python 3.9 and pymdp  
0.0.7.1 (15). We set the initial state (i.e., priors) of the Symbolic register at 0, with a 
preference value of 4. Concurrently, we maintain consistent priors and preferences for 
the other two registers. As depicted in Figure 1.d, when the Symbolic register aligns 
with its preferred position, the other two registers exhibit synchronous fluctuations , 
representing  the interconnectivity between th ree registers . This interconnectivity 
stems from the brain -wide propagation of divergence item and residual free energy. 
Consequently, this  recurrent  generative model not only embodies basic Lacanian idea 
including interdependent three registers and logical time, but also reflects the close 
relationship  between these two concepts.  
Numerous studies have harnessed active inference  to elucidate the principles underlying various brain functions, like emotion, interoception, consciousness, 
explanation, communication, culture, self -consciousness, body image, and 
sensorimotor, and so on (16-24). Our generative  model could offer a holistic and top -
down perspective on these functions  by treat them as different modalities within three 
registers . 
Desire as Partial Generalized Synchronization  
 To capture the dynamics of the human mind within real -world contexts, 
communication must not be overlooked.  In the field of active inference , 
communication  is investigated  with the paradigm involving two subjects with similar 
internal models (20, 25, 26) . To realize an  effective communication , two agents need to 
infer internal models and predict each other's behaviors, culminating in 
synchronization – a dynamic process referred to as  synchronization  of chaos or 
generalized synchronization . In this section, we aim to integrate the concept of desire into  
our computational psychoanalysis  model. Lacan frames the essence of desire as 
metaphor in linguistic fashion  (23). That is, envisioning two subjects as signifiers 
within a signifying chain, desire  of subject  is to seizure the signified of an object  (27). 
From the lens of complexity theory, the desire of one subject on other manifests as a 
tendency toward a generalized synchronization of their Symbolic registers. Since that 
our model consists of three registers, the process of desire , synchroniz ation of the 
Symbolic register s, entails partial generalized  synchronization  (Figure 2. a). This partial 
synchronization en ables that two synchronized subjects maintain their respective 
chaotic behaviors  (28).  
Figure 2. Desire as partial generalized synchronization between multiple individuals. 
(a) Two individuals, with the same internal model but different initial states, infer each 
other’s hidden state of the Symbolic registers as their own preferences, which guarantee a 
partial generalize synchronization.  When simulating such dynamics, we found that under 
identical condition, subsequent dynamics could be highly variable, and we display two of 
them, as illustrated in (b) and (c).  
To simulate such conditions, we design two subjects (A & B) with a shared internal 
model but differing initial states. At each time step, subjects A and B infer the state of 
each other's Symbolic register, treating these inferred states as their own preferences. 
The dynamics of these two subje cts' partial synchronization are illustrated in Figure 2 . 
b and c, spanning 15 -timesteps. Despite  our uncomplicated generative model , the 
subsequent dynamics exhibit significant diversity  under identical condition . In Figure 
2. b, the two subjects achieve rapid synchronization, whereas in Figure 2 . c, the 
synchronization remains  partial. This phenomenon may reflect the multifaceted  and 
random nature of human interaction and communication.  
Interestingly , as Figure 2b illustrates, when two subjects share the same internal 
model, a partial synchronization of their Symbolic registers can indirectly lead to the 
synchronization of the other two registers. This intriguing observation aligns with 
numerous studies indicating that romantic partners often exhibit shared autonomic 
physiology and emotional regulation across various timeframes  (29-31). One plausible 
interpretation is that the internal models of romantic partners tend to align over time 
due to the effects of long -term synchronization. This insight may open a novel avenue 
for exploring interpersonal dynamics.  This section sheds light on the vital role of 
communication in understanding the dynamics of the human mind. Integrating the 
concept of desire into computational psychoanalysis, we unveils desire as a 
mechanism driving partial synchronization between individuals, thereby deepening 
our comprehension of human connections and behaviors.  
Computational insights into  suicidal dynamics  
We have proposed a  recurrent  generative model based on Lacanian 
psychoanalysis and active inference , and simulated dynamics under controlled  
conditions. However, reality is far more tumultuous, and the human mind stands as 
an enigmatic puzzle without a readily available comprehensive solution. Despite this 
complexity,  we could use this model as helpful tool to comprehending  complex 
dynamics of mental  phenomena. Taking suicide thoughts and attempts as example , 
we will apply this model  to understand  the suicidal dynamics  in this section . 
Zizek suggests there are different modalities of suicide  in three registers  —— 
suicide as act bearing specific massages, as total closure of the Real  (direct 
identification of subject and object) , and as deprivation of symbolic identity  (32). A 
qualitative study analyzing the suicide notes of 12 individuals further substantiates 
these modalities,  including altered perception of self and other , ambivalence  of 
emotions , taking suicide as punishment, urge to escape from the symbolic network, 
and so on  (33). These emphasize  suicide is a comprehensive  disorder of three registers , 
and we could understand its dynamics via our generative model.  
As mentioned, desire courses along the Symbolic register , manifesting  as 
tendency towards partial synchronization. But under some conditions where desire 
fails, the synchronization is thwarted . Consequently, subject in the Symbolic register  grapple with  expected free energy that cannot be eliminated by any policy and 
residual free energy  that keeps accumulating . Suicide,  by doing nothing in the future, 
cancels out expected free energy  and halts the accumulation , and hence becomes the 
final policy which is described  as passage to the act  by Lacan, in meaning of an exit from 
the Symbolic.  On the other hand, other two registers have to cope with residual free 
energy caused by the Symbolic register, fostering  other two modalities of suicide.  
Corresponding fun ctions like self -representation, emotion, interoception, and so on 
become altered. Finally, this could give rise to actual suicide attempt . 
Consequently, within the three -dimensional state space defined by the three 
registers, suicide assumes the guise of a state in which the system relinquishes 
structural stability. This precarious state could potentially lead to "suicidal points," 
characteri zed by catastrophic bifurcations. Perturbations that push the system towards 
these critical junctures might serve as risk factors for suicide. To counteract this, 
interventions must be designed to redirect trajectories away from these suicidal points. 
Strategies such as social support, psychotherapeutic interventions, and appropriate 
medications hold promise in this regard.  
Moreover , the notion of expected and residual free energy introducing logical 
time raises a compelling parallel —symbolic suicide has the capacity to remove the 
subject from logical time, analogous to physical suicide's cessation of physical time. 
This notion echoe s Hendin's perspective on suicide as act to stop  time (34). And further 
explorations may yield more insights into phenomenology of suicide crises. In 
conclusion, the example of suicidal dynamics  illustrates the  theoretical and practical  
value of computational psychoanalysis , and additional research is warranted to 
validate and expand upon these initial findings . 
Concluding remarks  
Inspired by  prior researches in Lacanian (neuro)psychoanalysis and active 
inference , this work  offers theoretical foundation and computational evidence for 
incorporations of two fields and  provides an innovative perspective  by which  complex 
dynamics of human mind  could be dissected using lens of computational psychoanalysis.  Under the framework of active inference , we propose a recurrent 
generative model where key Lacanian concepts like three registers, logical time find 
computational form.  Central to our study is the novel conceptualization of desire as a 
mechanism of partial synchronization between individuals , shedding light on intricate 
patterns in human connections.  Finally, by exploring  dynamics of suicide with this 
model, we add a layer of depth and relevance to current work, demonstrating the 
clinical potential  implications . Eric Kandel, recipient of the 2000 Nobel Prize, believes 
that psychoanalysis is “the most coherent and intellectually satisfying view of human 
mind”, and will regain its energy through joining with cognitive neuroscience (35). 
Our work may help to  realize this prophecy  by offering a top -down avenue for this 
fusion through the realm of computational psychoanalysis.  
The model we proposed  acknowledges its simplicity . There are lots of modalities , 
multiple hierarchies , changeable parameters,  and distinct time scales  for each register . 
On the other hand, this model only captures several basic concepts of Lacanian 
psychoanalysis, which is essentially a theory of highly complexity . Further studies 
might complete this skeleton via calibration of model , descriptive interpretation, 
simulation of psychiatric disorders, appl ication into real-world data sets, and so on . In 
summary, this study presents a convergence that blends theoretical underpinnings 
with computational revelations . This research holds promise for comprehensive 
understanding of human mind and inspiring further exploration into the depths of 
cognition and behavior.
