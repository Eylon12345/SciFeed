Summary:

This paper proposes a new computational model that combines Lacanian psychoanalysis with active inference to provide a comprehensive understanding of the human mind. The model explores the concept of desire as partial generalized synchronization and applies it to the dynamics of suicide to demonstrate its theoretical and practical implications. The study highlights the potential of computational psychoanalysis in unraveling complex mental phenomena.

Bullet points:
