Summary:
The paper introduces UniBrain, a hierarchical knowledge-enhanced pre-training framework for universal brain MRI diagnosis. The framework leverages a large-scale dataset of brain imaging-report pairs and uses a hierarchical alignment mechanism to improve feature learning efficiency. UniBrain outperforms state-of-the-art diagnostic methods and shows comparable performance to expert radiologists on certain disease types.
