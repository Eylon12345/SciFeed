An active inference model of Lacanian psychoanalysis,"Summary:

This paper proposes a new computational model that combines Lacanian psychoanalysis with active inference to provide a comprehensive understanding of the human mind. The model explores the concept of desire as partial generalized synchronization and applies it to the dynamics of suicide to demonstrate its theoretical and practical implications. The study highlights the potential of computational psychoanalysis in unraveling complex mental phenomena.

Bullet points:

1. A new computational model combining Lacanian psychoanalysis and active inference is proposed to understand the human mind.
2. The model explores desire as partial generalized synchronization and its application to suicide dynamics.
3. The study demonstrates the theoretical and practical implications of computational psychoanalysis.
4. The three registers of Lacanian psychoanalysis (Imaginary, Symbolic, Real) and the concept of logical time are key components of the proposed model.
5. The study highlights the potential of computational psychoanalysis in uncovering complex mental phenomena.

UniBrain: Universal Brain MRI Diagnosis with Hierarchical Knowledge-enhanced Pre-training,"Summary:
The paper introduces UniBrain, a hierarchical knowledge-enhanced pre-training framework for universal brain MRI diagnosis. The framework leverages a large-scale dataset of brain imaging-report pairs and uses a hierarchical alignment mechanism to improve feature learning efficiency. UniBrain outperforms state-of-the-art diagnostic methods and shows comparable performance to expert radiologists on certain disease types.

Bullet points:
1. UniBrain is a pre-training framework for universal brain MRI diagnosis.
2. It leverages a large-scale dataset of brain imaging-report pairs for feature learning.
3. UniBrain uses a hierarchical alignment mechanism to improve feature learning efficiency.
4. UniBrain outperforms state-of-the-art diagnostic methods on three real-world datasets.
5. It shows comparable performance to expert radiologists on certain disease types.
